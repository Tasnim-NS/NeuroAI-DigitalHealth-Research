# NeuroAI and Digital Health Research Group ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the **NeuroAI and Digital Health Research Group**! We focus on cutting-edge AI/ML applications in neurotechnology, sleep science, and neurodegenerative disease detection.

## ðŸš€ Research Projects

### 1. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Neurofeedback
**Goal**: Enhance attention/memory and manage fatigue using gamified EEG neurofeedback.  
**Tech**: BCI, Frontal Midline Theta (FM-theta), eye tracking, deep learning.  
[Details](/projects/BCI-Neurofeedback/README.md)

### 2. PPG-Based Sleep Stage Classification
**Goal**: Classify sleep stages using PPG signals and detect sleep disorders.  
**Tech**: Attention-based CNNs, XAI, smartwatch deployment.  
[Details](/projects/PPG-Sleep-Classification/README.md)

### 3. AI-Driven Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Detection
**Goal**: Early diagnosis via facial emotion and motor symptom analysis.  
**Tech**: Computer vision, deep learning (e.g., CNN, Transformers).
